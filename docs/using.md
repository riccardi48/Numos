# Using Numos
Numos is intentionally designed to be engine-agnostic and self-contained.
As such, creating and performing operations on the simulation is relatively simple.

For almost every game or engine integration, `Numos.API` is the package to start with. It is the supported facade around the simulator and is deliberately shaped around handles, validated operations, and detached snapshots instead of direct access to the kernel's mutable data. Interacting with the sim is done entirely through this API surface.

> [!WARNING]
> The packages are still prerelease while Numos is a prototype. Include prerelease versions when installing them, and expect the `0.x` API surface to continue moving as the simulation matures.

## Packages
Numos has two independently versioned package families:

- The CoreSim family contains `Numos.Maths`, `Numos.CoreSim`, `Numos.API`, and `Numos.API.Dangerous`.
- The Viewer family contains `Numos.SimDrawer` and `Numos.Viewer`.

Consumers should generally add only `Numos.API` and go from there. NuGet restores its required CoreSim and maths packages transitively.

```shell
dotnet add package Numos.API --prerelease
```

`Numos.Maths` is generally restored as a dependency, though an engine adapter may want to reference it explicitly for Numos' `Int3`,
which is used in the API.

## Creating a Simulation
An `AtmosSimulation` owns the chunks registered with it and the buffers used by its solver. Dispose it when the game world or simulation session ends. The constructor takes fixed chunk dimensions; every chunk in one simulation has those dimensions.

```csharp
using Numos.API;
using Numos.CoreSim;
using Numos.Maths;

using var simulation = new AtmosSimulation(
    chunkWidth: 16,
    chunkHeight: 16,
    chunkDepth: 16);

AtmosChunkHandle chunk = simulation.CreateAndRegisterChunk(new Int3(0, 0, 0));
```

The `Int3` passed to `CreateAndRegisterChunk` is a position in the chunk grid, not a voxel position. A chunk handle identifies that position inside its owning simulation. It does not expose the chunk's internal arrays, and it should not be treated as valid for another simulation just because it has the same position (doing so is effectively undefined behavior).

Register chunks when world regions become relevant and call `UnregisterChunk` when they are no longer needed and should be disposed.

The constructor above creates a private, one-simulation `AtmosWorld` for compatibility. Integrations with multiple
grids, portals, or docking should create one world explicitly and create each storage domain through it:

```csharp
using var world = new AtmosWorld(config);
AtmosSimulation station = world.CreateSimulation(16, 16, 16);
AtmosSimulation shuttle = world.CreateSimulation(16, 16, 16);
```

Every simulation in a world receives the same immutable configuration snapshot. Calling `SetAtmosConfig` through the
world or any registered simulation replaces that shared snapshot for all of them. Chunks remain owned by exactly one
simulation; docking never copies, shares, or migrates chunk storage.

## Connect cells with portals and docks

Ordinary neighbors remain implicit Cartesian neighbors. A sparse explicit link connects cells that cannot be inferred
from chunk coordinates, including cells in different simulations. Obtain stable value-only cell references from their
owners and create a portal like this:

```csharp
AtmosCellRef stationCell = station.GetCellRef(stationChunk, stationVoxelIndex);
AtmosCellRef shuttleCell = shuttle.GetCellRef(shuttleChunk, shuttleVoxelIndex);

AtmosPortalHandle portal = world.CreatePortal(stationCell, shuttleCell);
```

`CreatePortal`, `CreateDock`, and `CreateLinks` all compile to the same undirected solver edge representation. A dock is
a batch of corresponding surface-cell links and is removed as one unit:

```csharp
AtmosDockHandle dock = world.CreateDock(surfaceLinks);
// Later:
world.DestroyDock(dock);
```

Creation and removal are queued. They take effect at the start of the next world tick, when `TopologyVersion` advances.
Endpoint order is canonicalized, a physical edge can be registered only once, and stale handles are rejected after the
removal boundary. Removing a chunk or simulation invalidates only link sets indexed to that owner. Link activation wakes
the endpoint chunks locally so a pressurized cell cannot be hidden by a sleeping peer.

`ExplicitLinkFlags.GasTransport` permits pressure flow, diffusion, and the thermal energy carried by gas.
`ThermalTransport` permits conductive heat transfer independently of gas movement. Combine them with `All` for an open
atmospheric connection. Numos' default `explicit-gas-transport` and `explicit-thermal-transport` pipeline stages
evaluate every active edge carrying the matching flag from an unchanged input state, limit all outgoing requests for
each cell and species together, accumulate equal-and-opposite deltas, and commit each participating cell once.

Those two stages are ordinary pipeline stages, not special-cased behavior: `world.Solvers.SetEnabled` can turn either
one off world-wide, and a link can carry a host-defined flag bit beyond `GasTransport`/`ThermalTransport` purely so a
host-registered solver's selector can pick it out instead. See
[Extending portal and dock transport](atmospherics_technical_documentation.md#extending-portal-and-dock-transport)
for the full pattern, including replacing default transport entirely or per-link.

## Use portals from a custom solver

A plain `world.Solvers.Register(...)` stage cannot see portals or docks at all: `context.Topology` compiles to an
empty view for it, so `GetOwnedEdges()` quietly returns nothing. To see explicit links, register through
`RegisterNeighborSolver` (or its `Before`/`After` variants) with an `AtmosNeighborSelection`, since an explicit edge
can join cells in two different simulations and the world — not either simulation — is what compiles the combined
view:

```csharp
world.Solvers.RegisterNeighborSolverAfter(
    AtmosBuiltInSolvers.Advection,
    "game/fire-spread",
    new AtmosNeighborSelection(
        "game/fire-spread/v1",
        includeCartesian: true,
        static link => (link.Flags & ExplicitLinkFlags.GasTransport) != 0),
    context =>
    {
        foreach (AtmosNeighborEdge edge in context.Topology.GetOwnedEdges())
            ProcessFireEdge(edge.First, edge.Second);
    });
```

Fire wants `includeCartesian: true` because it spreads through ordinary open doorways as well as portals. A solver
that only cares about the portals and docks themselves should say so explicitly instead:

```csharp
world.Solvers.RegisterNeighborSolver(
    "game/pressure-valve",
    new AtmosNeighborSelection(
        "game/pressure-valve/v1",
        includeCartesian: false, // no ordinary walls — this only ever acts on explicit links
        static link => (link.Flags & ExplicitLinkFlags.GasTransport) != 0),
    context =>
    {
        foreach (AtmosNeighborEdge edge in context.Topology.GetOwnedEdges())
            ProcessValveEdge(edge.First, edge.Second);
    });
```

`includeCartesian: true` makes `GetOwnedEdges()` walk all six directions of every voxel in every chunk in the world to
find the ordinary boundaries too; `false` limits it to the sparse explicit edge list. Pick the one that matches what
the stage actually needs to see, since the wasted Cartesian walk is easy to miss until you profile it.

`GetOwnedEdges` visits each physical adjacency once, which is the useful form for conservative transfer. Stencil
solvers can instead acquire a chunk view once and call `GetNeighborCount` or `GetNeighbors` for each source cell. Both
forms emit Cartesian and selected explicit adjacency through the same solver code.

Numos evaluates the link selector when topology or solver registration changes and compiles sparse incident indexes
only for chunks containing selected explicit endpoints. Stable ticks do not rediscover portals or call the selector
again, which is also why the selector itself must be a pure function of the link's flags and endpoints — it cannot
read per-tick state. The topology view describes structural adjacency only; it does not filter out solid or void
endpoints, so a solver that moves gas or heat must check current voxel classification itself before touching an edge,
the same way the built-in transport stages do.

A cell can carry any number of explicit links, unlike a Cartesian voxel's fixed six neighbors. A solver that mutates
gas or energy across links needs the same shape the built-in stages use: compute every edge's request from one
unchanged snapshot of the tick's starting state, cap everything leaving one cell for one gas with a single shared
limiter, then commit. Reading and writing one edge at a time lets edge order decide who drains a shared cell first,
which breaks Numos' determinism guarantees. See
[Writing a custom solver that touches portals](atmospherics_technical_documentation.md#writing-a-custom-solver-that-touches-portals)
for the full reasoning and the obligations (skip solid/void endpoints, call `Wake()` after a raw mutation) a solver
needs to satisfy on its own.

The supported view returns value-only cell references. A measured hot path can reference `Numos.API.Dangerous` and call
`context.Dangerous().GetChunk(cell)` inside the callback to resolve live structure-of-arrays storage. As with other
dangerous APIs, the solver must repair every cache, sleep, and revision invariant affected by raw writes — including
waking any chunk it touched, since a raw span write does not do that automatically.

World checkpoints include each simulation checkpoint, link-set generations and lifecycle state, and the applied topology
version:

```csharp
AtmosWorldCheckpoint checkpoint = world.CaptureCheckpoint();
// mutate and tick the world
world.RestoreCheckpoint(checkpoint);
```

Restore keeps matching registrations in place, disposes registrations absent from the checkpoint, and recreates missing
registrations that use only built-in solvers. A retained registration must still have compatible chunk dimensions and a
compatible solver pipeline. Numos cannot recreate a missing custom solver because its host delegate is not checkpointed.
Restore rebuilds sparse indexes and resets the elapsed-time accumulator.

## Driving the Solver

Numos uses a fixed simulation rate. In a normal engine loop, give the facade the elapsed real time and let it retain partial steps and process complete ticks.

```csharp
void UpdateAtmospherics(float deltaSeconds)
{
    world.Update(deltaSeconds);
}
```

`AtmosWorld.Update` limits catch-up work so a long frame does not create an unbounded solver stall. If an integration
needs deterministic step-by-step control, for example in a test or a lockstep simulation, call `Tick()` instead.
`Tick()` runs exactly one fixed solver tick and does not use the elapsed-time accumulator. Compatibility calls through
`AtmosSimulation.Update` and `AtmosSimulation.Tick` drive that simulation's owning world, so use the world directly
whenever it contains multiple simulations.

Do not call into one `AtmosSimulation` from unrelated ownership systems without deciding who owns its lifecycle and update order first. Numos parallelizes work inside the simulation; an engine integration should still present one coherent sequence of topology changes, gas injections, and ticks.

## Chunks, Voxels, and Gas Sources

Register each gas before injecting it, then use its exact, case-sensitive name. A new `AtmosConfig` has an empty gas
registry; Numos does not reserve ID 0 for a built-in gas. Applications choose the gases and their physical properties.

This example adds oxygen to the running simulation's configuration and injects it into a voxel. Amounts are in moles and
temperatures are in kelvins.

```csharp
var config = new AtmosConfig(simulation.Config);
config.GasRegistry.Add(new GasProperties
{
    Name = "Oxygen",
    MolarHeatCapacityAtConstantVolume = AtmosPhysicalConstants.IdealDiatomicMolarHeatCapacityAtConstantVolume,
    DiffusionCoefficient = 0.02f
});
simulation.SetAtmosConfig(config);

simulation.AddGasToVoxel(
    chunk,
    x: 8,
    y: 8,
    z: 0,
    gasName: "Oxygen",
    moles: 500f,
    temperature: 293.15f);
```

For initial setup, populate an `AtmosConfig` and pass it to the simulation constructor. Later builder changes only apply
after `SetAtmosConfig`; the simulation keeps an immutable copy.

`GasMixture` and `IGasMixture` also accept names in `GetMoles`, `SetMoles`, `AdjustMoles`, and `AddGas`. Unknown names
throw `KeyNotFoundException`. Numeric mutation overloads remain available for existing integrations, but reject negative
or unregistered IDs with `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` before changing gas state. Prefer names in application code:
numeric IDs depend on registration order and remain useful for snapshots, replay, and solver storage.

A registered gas can deliberately use the configured heat-capacity fallback by leaving its heat capacity unset. That
fallback does not make an unregistered ID valid for injection.

## Sharing dependencies between solvers

`GetOrCreateSolverData<T>` gives cooperating stages a shared object without requiring either solver to hold a reference
to the other. Each simulation owns its own slots. Solvers agree on a key and an exact type, then supply a factory used
only on the first request:

```csharp
simulation.World.Solvers.Register("produce", _ =>
{
    var pending = simulation.GetOrCreateSolverData("custom/pending", static () => new Queue<int>());
    pending.Clear();
    pending.Enqueue(simulation.TickCount);
});
simulation.World.Solvers.RegisterAfter("produce", "consume", _ =>
{
    var pending = simulation.GetOrCreateSolverData("custom/pending", static () => new Queue<int>());
    while (pending.TryDequeue(out int tick))
        Console.WriteLine(tick);
});
```

Strings compare ordinally; other keys use reference identity. A shared private object key avoids collisions with
unrelated plugins. Values can also be interfaces backed by caller-provided services: request the same interface type
from every stage. Reference types retain identity; structs are returned by value. Null results, type mismatches, and
factory cycles throw; failed creation leaves the slot available for a retry. Factories may resolve other slots but must
not mutate the simulation.

Sharing data does not change execution order. Register producers before consumers, and define how a consumer behaves
when its producer is disabled or removed. Built-in advection and thermodynamics use shared concurrent queues for their
boundary stages. Producers clear their queues before parallel chunk work; consumers reject events from earlier ticks and
sort current events before applying cross-chunk changes sequentially.

Resolve shared data before starting worker tasks: facade calls from workers would block on the tick's state lock. Numos
serializes lookup and creation; solvers synchronize later access to mutable values. A `ConcurrentQueue<T>` works for
parallel producers, but consumers still need a stable ordering when processing order affects simulation results.

Shared data survives ticks, configuration changes, solver removal, and pipeline resets. Checkpoint restoration and
simulation disposal discard it without disposing the values. Reacquire on each callback and keep ownership of disposable
services in host code. These slots are transient: snapshots, checkpoints, recordings, and state hashes exclude them.
Rebuild replay-relevant data from authoritative inputs; use captured chunk solver arrays for evolving state that must
roll back, or gas attachments below for caches invalidated by configuration changes.

## Attaching solver data to gases

Custom solvers can attach their own data to a registered gas without adding fields to `GasProperties`.
`GetOrCreateGasSolverData<T>` stores one value per simulation, gas ID, and key, shared by all chunks:

```csharp
private readonly object _coolingKey = new();

public void Solve(AtmosSimulation simulation)
{
    float coolingFactor = simulation.GetOrCreateGasSolverData(
        gasId: 0, _coolingKey, gas => 1f / gas.MolarHeatCapacityAtConstantVolume);
    // Use coolingFactor when processing this gas in any chunk.
}
```

The factory receives normalized gas properties and runs only when that attachment is missing. Values can be custom
classes, structs, arrays, or dictionaries. Request the same exact `T` for a slot on every call; a different type throws.
Reference types retain identity, while structs are returned by value. Private object keys keep independent solvers
separate; string keys compare ordinally and allow deliberate sharing.

Attachments survive ticks and solver removal. Applying a changed configuration discards them, even when only reaction
definitions change. This prevents cached gas or reaction indices from referring to the wrong entry after a registry
edit. The built-in reaction solver uses this mechanism to cache each gas's coefficients by reaction ID and its linear
rate factors or standard rate-law exponents before starting its workers. During a callback, attachments use the
tick-start configuration; a configuration change takes effect on the next tick or the next attachment request outside a
callback.

Use these attachments for derived data or scratch storage. They are excluded from snapshots, checkpoints, recordings,
and state hashes, and are discarded on checkpoint restoration. A replayable solver must rebuild them from configuration
or other authoritative inputs. Evolving state that needs automatic rollback belongs in chunk solver arrays created with
`captureForRollback: true`.

Reacquire attachments on each callback. Acquire them before dispatching worker tasks, since facade calls from a worker
would block on the tick's state lock. The factory must not mutate the simulation or recursively request its own slot.
Numos serializes creation; the solver synchronizes subsequent access to mutable values.

## Configuring solvers without extending AtmosConfig

Solver settings belong in `AtmosConfig.SolverConfigurations`. The simulation captures them through
`IAtmosSolverConfiguration`, so a custom solver can define its own settings without adding fields to Numos. Keys are
unique, nonempty strings; snapshots order them ordinally so registration order does not change hashes.

Custom configuration implementations must return immutable, detached snapshots, compare all authoritative settings in
`SemanticallyEquals`, and provide a deterministic `ComputeStateHash`. Immutable value objects can return themselves from
`CreateSnapshot`; editable builders must copy their values and collections. For example:

```csharp
public sealed record FireSettings(int Strength) : IAtmosSolverConfiguration
{
    public string Key => "my-game/fire";
    public IAtmosSolverConfiguration CreateSnapshot(IGasRegistry gases) => this;
    public bool SemanticallyEquals(IAtmosSolverConfiguration other) => Equals(other);
    public ulong ComputeStateHash() => unchecked((ulong)Strength);
}
```

Register it in `config.SolverConfigurations` and read its applied snapshot from
`simulation.Config.SolverConfigurations` in the custom solver. Include every execution-relevant field in the hash; do
not use process-randomized hashes such as `HashCode` or `string.GetHashCode()`. Configuration changes are recorded and
restored with checkpoints. Derived gas attachments remain transient.

## Reading Simulation State
The facade returns detached snapshots for presentation, networking, and gameplay decisions. A snapshot is safe to retain after the call, but it is not live: request another snapshot when a consumer needs newer state.

```csharp
var snapshot = simulation.GetChunkSnapshot(chunk);
var voxel = simulation.GetVoxelSnapshot(chunk, localVoxelIndex: 0);
```

For renderers that already know which revision they presented, `TryGetVoxelSnapshot` can avoid copying gas data when the chunk has changed. `TryGetChunkHandles` similarly lets a retained consumer refresh its handle list only when chunks are added or removed. These APIs are preferable to holding internal data or scanning the simulation every frame.

## Using the Viewer
`Numos.Viewer` is the optional desktop presentation layer built with raylib and ImGui. It brings in `Numos.API` and `Numos.SimDrawer`, and its package includes the icon and ImGui layout assets required by the application.

```shell
dotnet add package Numos.Viewer --prerelease
```

The viewer is intended for a desktop environment with graphics support. It can be hosted from C# by constructing a `SimulationViewer` and calling `Run()`. The Viewer About dialog shows both Viewer and CoreSim package versions, source references, and commit hashes so a tester can identify exactly which build they are running.

## Dangerous API
`Numos.API.Dangerous` is intentionally separate from `Numos.API`.

```shell
dotnet add package Numos.API.Dangerous --prerelease
```

Importing `Numos.API.Dangerous` adds the `simulation.Dangerous()` extension. This package exists for measured, performance-sensitive, or experimental integration work where the supported facade is insufficient. It is not a way to skip learning the supported lifecycle, topology, or physics rules.

The dangerous surface may bypass validation and is allowed to change more aggressively than the supported API. Keep its use behind a small adapter in an engine integration, document every assumption it relies on, and prefer a regular safe API over the dangerous one whenever possible.

## Recording and deterministic replay

`AtmosSimulation` supports synchronous mutation recording, full grid checkpoints, restore into an existing compatible
simulation, exact tick/sequence replay and stable state hashes. `AtmosReplayTimeline` retains history for inspection and
can continue simulation from a selected historical state. The Viewer layers session-only branches over the world
timeline and can export the selected branch as a linear replay.
See [deterministic replay](deterministic_replay.md)
for examples, the optional `Numos.Serialization` and `Numos.Serialization.FileSystem` packages, compatibility rules,
detached-mixture scope and benchmark commands.
